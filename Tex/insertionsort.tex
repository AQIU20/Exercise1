\nsection{A Simple Spelling Checker}

Here, we reads words one at a time
from file and carefully place them in the {\bf correct} part of
our data structure. This has a complexty of $O(n^2)$.

For this purpose, a list of valid words (unsorted) is available
from the usual place.

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex:arrayinsertsort}
Write a program which, based on a
list implemented using {\bf arrays}, reads the words in
one at a time, inserting them into the {\bf correct} part of the list
so that the words are alphabetically sorted.
The name of the file should be passed as \verb^argv[1]^,
and you can assume the array is of a fixed-size,
and large enough to hold all words.
How long does it take to build the list ?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Now extend Exercise~\ref{ex:arrayinsertsort}
so that when the user is prompted for a word,
they are told whether this word is present in the list or not.
Use a binary search to achieve this.
How much faster is this than a linear search~?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Now extend Exercise~\ref{ex:arrayinsertsort}
so that when the user is prompted for a word,
they are told whether this word is present in the list or not.
Use an interpolation search to achieve this.
How much faster is this than a linear search~?

\begin{exercise}
Write a program which, based on a
linked list data structure, reads the words in
one at a time, inserting them into the {\bf correct} part of the list
so that the words are alphabetically sorted.
The name of the file should be passed as \verb^argv[1]^.
