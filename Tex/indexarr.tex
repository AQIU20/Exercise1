\nsection{Indexed Arrays}
In the usual places are the files \verb^arr.h^, \verb^testarr.c^
and a Makefile. My files \verb^general.c^ and \verb^general.h^ (if you want to
use them) are in the ADT section of the github site.
You will write \verb^Realloc/realloc.c^ and \verb^Realloc/specific.h^.
These files will allow you to build, and test, the
ADT for a 1D Indexed Array. This simple replacement for C arrays is
`safe' in the sense that if you write the array out-of-bounds, it
will be automatically resized correctly (using \verb^realloc()^). The
interface to this ADT is in \verb^arr.h^ and its implementation will be in \verb^Realloc/realloc.c^
Typing \verb^make^, compiles these files together with the test
file \verb^testarr.c^. Executing \verb^./testarr^ should result in all
tests passing correctly.

\begin{terminaloutput}
% make run
Basic Array Tests ... Start
Basic Array Tests ... Stop
\end{terminaloutput}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex:indarray}
Write \verb^Realloc/realloc.c^ nd \verb^specific.h^ so that the functionality in the driver code \verb^testarr.c^ is implemented.
\end{exercise}
