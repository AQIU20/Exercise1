In the usual places are the files \verb^arr.h^, \verb^arr.c^, \verb^testarr.c^
and a makefile. These files enable you to build, and test, the
ADT for a 1D Indexed Array. This simple replacement for C arrays is
`safe' in the sense that if you write the array out-of-bounds, it
will be automatically resized correctly (using \verb^realloc()^). The
interface to this ADT is in \verb^arr.h^ and its implementation is in
\verb^arr.c^. Typing \verb^make testarr^, compiles these files together with the test
file \verb^testarr.c^. Executing \verb^./testarr^ should result in all
tests passing correctly.

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex:indarray}
Build \verb^testarr^, and check that you understand the use of the functions,
including initialization, reading, writing and freeing. Use the makefile provided to
run the code, and do some memory-leak checking etc.
\end{exercise}
