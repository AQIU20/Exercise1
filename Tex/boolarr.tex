\nsection{Boolean Arrays}

Here we create an ADT for Boolean Arrays, allowing logical operations to be performed on an entire array.

\noindent
This will involve manipulation of the bits of the data
using the C bitwise logical operators `xor' (\verb#^#), `or' (\verb^|^) and `and' (\verb^&^).

\begin{exercise}
Given the files \verb^testboolarr.c^ and \verb^boolarr.h^, complete the Boolean Array ADT using
a reallocating array of unsigned chars. You will need to write both \verb^realloc.c^, which will define the 
functions in boolarr.h, and \verb^specific.h^, which will contain your header information. 
Ignoring the overhead of the main structure, 
which might store the capacity of the underlying array, and the number of valid bits in use, 
the array should be around $~$\verb^nbits^$/8$ bytes in length.
