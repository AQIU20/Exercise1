\nsection{Int to String}

\begin{exercise}
Write a function that converts an integer
to a string, so that the following code snippet
works correctly:

\begin{codesnippet}
int i;
char s[256];
scanf("%d", &i);
int2string(i,s);
printf("%s\n", s);
\end{codesnippet}

The integer may be signed (i.e.\ be positive or negative)
and you may assume it is in base-10.

Avoid using any of the built-in string-handling functions
to do this (e.g. \verb^itoa()^!) including those in \verb^string.h^.
