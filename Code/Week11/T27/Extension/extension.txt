it replaced the original 27-way tree with a dynamic linked tree structure to slove wasted memory.

Comparison
The 27-way tree is efficient for fixed character sets like alphabets but uses a fixed-size dwn[ALPHA] array for each node, which wastes memory.
The linked tree doesn’t waste memory because it only creates nodes when needed, but it’s slower for some operations.

Flexibility
The 27-way tree is not flexible and hard to expand or reduce.
The linked tree is more flexible because it uses dynamic memory and linked lists for managing nodes.

Lookup Efficiency
The 27-way tree is faster for searching, with a time complexity of O(1) per level.
The linked tree is slower, with a time complexity of O(n) per level, because it searches through sibling nodes.

Conclusion
The 27-way tree is simple, with fixed memory and clear logic.
The linked tree is more complex but more flexible and uses memory more efficiently.
